How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
 introduced?

    this help me compare the two files and see just de differences between them!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    i can go back and view the beging (history) off the code and see the evolution and differences

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    if i know what i'am doing, in the manual choosing, i save the rigth changes, not less or to most or nthe midle... 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because in git we are working in some files and they mybe interconnected. In googledocs i work in a single file at with time...
	
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    the command git log give me the id file version and the command git diff give me the changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    i always can go back, if i have done commit.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	my app
